## Usage

### Example: Setting up Logging

Here is an example of how to use `LogsManager` in your Python application:

```python
from logsmanager import LogManager

# Configure logging
log_manager = LogManager(
    filename='app.log',  # Log file name
    file_level='WARNING',  # Minimum log level for file
    stream_level='INFO',  # Minimum log level for console output
    log_dir='logs',  # Directory to store logs
).logger

# Example logging
log_manager.info('This is an info message.')
log_manager.warning('This is a warning message.')
log_manager.error('This is an error message.')
```

### Features

1. **File Logging**
   Logs events to a specified file in the defined directory.

2. **Rotating File Logging**
   Automatically rotates log files when they exceed a defined size:
   ```python
   log_manager = LogManager(
       filename='rotating.log',
       rotating_file_level='INFO',
       max_bytes=5000,  # Max size of log file in bytes
       backup_count=3,  # Number of backup files to keep
   ).logger
   ```

3. **Stream Logging**
   Logs events to the console:
   ```python
   log_manager = LogManager(
       stream_level='DEBUG',
   ).logger
   ```
